### V4 Aug 6, 23
JudgeGPT is now voiced by ai, and live at https://brennan.games/JudgeGPTüë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è
V4 now has the option to turn on voices! They are fantastic,  hilarious an shockingly human for ai generated voices. Make sure you turn it on first thing when loading up the game.
The game exists as a single multiplayer courtroom. Join in on the action, or watch the current hearing and wait your turn to be served justice!
Whiles it‚Äôs v4, it‚Äôs still buggy. If it gets stuck, there is a restart server button at the bottom! üòÖ

Convince the ai judge you are innocent. 
Efficient and succinct justice with all the bias and inaccuracy of ai.

Note: Game is still in development. There is only one courtroom, so if you aren't in the hearing you are in the audience. If it seems stuck, there is a restart button at the bottom.

### V2 July 24, 23
Latest version of JudgeGPT is looking great!

Now runs as a single session, that is networked mutliplayer using sockets. So everyone will be connected to the same live-case, and be able to join and participate as it comes up with new cases.

UI has been improved a lot, and has better mobile support.

### V0  ‚Äî 07/16/2023 1:43 PM
So I am working on this game called JudgeGPT. 

Its a game based in a futuristic small claims court room, where ai has replaced the lawyers & judges in the legal system. You and another player fight it out in the court room to see who wins the case.

It is early stages, proof of concept prototype. What do you think?
I am looking for feedback on what the UI could look like. I was originally thinking a simple chatbot, but I want to make it more legally / court-y. Any thoughts? What does a the future of virtual court rooms look like?

Notes
So far its only 2 player
